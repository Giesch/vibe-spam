* Now
- [-] add lobby to home page
  - [X] add ugly version without subscription
  - [ ] subscribe to open games
    this will require figuring out redis pubsub
    how does this interact with paging?
    does this get rid of the need for a 'list' query?
    - [ ] figure out redis pubsub
    - [ ] figure out server websocket (handled by async-graphql?)
    - [ ] figure out client websocket

* Next
- [ ] make it look good
- [-] catch up reading z2p
  idempotency is the only one left
- [ ] make websocket conn reliable
  mimic how phoenix channels handle reconnect

* Soon

* Someday
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
