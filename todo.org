* Now
- [ ] add chat room page
  - [ ] decide to continue with elm or use bevy client for demo
  - [ ] use another dedicated redis conn for all chat messages?
  - [ ] add a table for chat messages
  - [ ] if elm:
    - [ ]

* Next
- [ ] tests for lobby subscription
  this will need multiple test gql clients

* Soon
- [ ] test lobby flag with actual rooms present
  just need to create a room in the test
- [ ] display nicer date/time for last activity
  need iso 8601 package that asks itself not to be used
- [ ] unsubscribe from lobby on leaving lobby?
  this would require a special link handler in Main.elm
  need an 'unsubscribe from all' toJs port msg?
  - could just call that on all page transitions (before Page.init)
- [ ] remove expect calls from pubsub?
  panicing might be right, but the joinhandle result has to be handled
  a decode error in a message the server sent to itself is a programmer error

* Someday
- [ ] add a way to generate types from the local gql api
  - [ ] run ci elm build against both prod gql and branch gql
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
- [ ] use elm-ts-interop for ports
  convert main.js to ts? does vite make this easy?
- [ ] see if it's possible to switch from urql to urql-core
- [ ] optimistic updates?
- [ ] disconnect/reconnect handling for subscriptions
  - mimic phoenix channels - exponential backoff
- [ ] tracing with honeycomb
- [ ] NotFound page
- [ ] is the elm build not caching deps correctly?
  scripts include calls to 'npm ci'
- [ ] use structured build config:
  https://github.com/MattCheely/elm-build-config

* Other
- [-] catch up reading z2p
  idempotency is the only one left
- [ ] elm-review editor setup
  - [ ] disable elm analyze emacs setup - this is in lsp?
  - [ ] add elm review emacs setup (or switch to intellij?)
  - [ ] investigate elm-pair emacs setup
- [ ] use ints for times in json instead of DateTime?
