* Now
- [X] deploy the app!
- [ ] add lobby to home page
  - [ ] list open games (paging)
  - [ ] create an open game
    generate the game name
    no password for now
  - [ ] subscribe to open games
    this will require figuring out redis pubsub
    how does this interact with paging?
    does this get rid of the need for a 'list' query?
    - [ ] figure out redis pubsub
    - [ ] figure out websocket

* Next
- [-] catch up reading z2p
- [ ] make websocket conn reliable
  mimic how phoenix channels handle reconnect

* Soon

* Someday
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
