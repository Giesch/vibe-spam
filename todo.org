* Now
- [ ] unsubscribe from lobby on leaving lobby
  this might require some special link handler in Main.elm
  need an 'unsubscribe from all' toJs port msg?
  - [ ] call unsubscribe on all page transitions
  - [ ] manually test this

* Next

  this will need multiple test gql clients

- [ ] make home/lobby page look decent

* Soon
- [ ] add chat room page
  - [ ] plan layout/visuals first?
- [ ] change unsubscribe port msg to unsubscribe from all

* Someday
- [ ] set up elm review
  - [ ] disable elm analyze emacs setup
  - [ ] add elm review emacs setup (or switch to intellij?)
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
- [ ] use elm-ts-interop for ports
  convert main.js to ts? does vite make this easy?
  yeah, it just strips out types - need to set up a tsc step in ci
- [ ] see if it's possible to switch from urql to urql-core
- [ ] optimistic updates?
- [ ] disconnect/reconnect handling for subscriptions
  - mimic phoenix channels - exponential backoff
- [ ] tracing with honeycomb
