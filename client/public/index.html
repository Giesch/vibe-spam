    <!-- NOTE
         In prod, a div with flags json content is added via a backend template.
         In local dev, the div is injected after hitting a json endpoint.
         This makes things weird.

         The real html served is in /templates.index.html,
         so html changes here must be duplicated there.
         However, javascript in this file does get compiled into the final index.js by vite.
         Avoid adding more javascript here to keep the build from getting more confusing.
