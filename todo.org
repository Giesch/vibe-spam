* Now
- [ ] add lobby to flags
- [ ] make it look decent
- [ ] add chat room page

* Next
- [ ] remove expect calls from pubsub
  the initial subscribe expect should stay
  decode errors - at least log, maybe publish to watcher

- [ ] unsubscribe from lobby on leaving lobby
  this might require some special link handler in Main.elm
  need an 'unsubscribe from all' toJs port msg?
  - could just call that on all page transitions

* Soon
- [ ] tests for subscriptions
  this will need multiple test gql clients
- [ ] test lobby flag with actual rooms present
  just need to create a room in the test
- [-] set up elm review
  - [X] add to project
  - [X] add to ci
  - [X] add banned comment tags
  - [X] fix remaining errors
  - [X] require in ci
  - [ ] disable elm analyze emacs setup
  - [ ] add elm review emacs setup (or switch to intellij?)

* Someday
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
- [ ] use elm-ts-interop for ports
  convert main.js to ts? does vite make this easy?
- [ ] see if it's possible to switch from urql to urql-core
- [ ] optimistic updates?
- [ ] disconnect/reconnect handling for subscriptions
  - mimic phoenix channels - exponential backoff
- [ ] tracing with honeycomb
- [ ] NotFound page
- [ ] is the elm build not caching deps correctly?
  scripts include calls to 'npm ci'

* Other
- [-] catch up reading z2p
  idempotency is the only one left
