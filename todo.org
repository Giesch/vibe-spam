* Now
- [ ] add BE chat mutation (create/publish a message)
- [ ] add FE chat mutation (create/publish a message)

* Next
- [ ] handle FE subscription events
  need to dedupe messages? not at first
- [ ] tests for lobby subscription
  this will need multiple test gql clients

* Soon
- [ ] test lobby flag with actual rooms present
  just need to create a room in the test
- [ ] display nicer date/time for last activity
  need iso 8601 package that asks itself not to be used
- [ ] unsubscribe from lobby on leaving lobby?
  this would require a special link handler in Main.elm
  need an 'unsubscribe from all' toJs port msg?
  - could just call that on all page transitions (before Page.init)
- [ ] remove expect calls from pubsub?
  panicing might be right, but the joinhandle result has to be handled
  a decode error in a message the server sent to itself is a programmer error
- [ ] pending state when adding a room
- [ ] make the random room name dictionary larger
- [ ] customize custom scalars (ie more specific ids)

* Someday
- [ ] make the axum fallback route in local dev point back to vite server
- [ ] use elm-ts-interop for ports
  - [ ] convert js files to ts
- [ ] see if it's possible to switch from urql to urql-core
- [ ] optimistic updates?
- [ ] disconnect/reconnect handling for subscriptions
  - mimic phoenix channels - exponential backoff
- [ ] tracing with honeycomb
- [ ] NotFound page
- [ ] is the elm build not caching deps correctly?
  scripts include calls to 'npm ci'
- [ ] use structured build config:
  https://github.com/MattCheely/elm-build-config
- [ ] consider using flume instead of tokio broadcast
- [ ] run ci elm build against both prod gql and branch gql
- [ ] make a uuid wrapper that's easier to use; customize codec to generate that

* Other
- [-] catch up reading z2p
  idempotency is the only one left
- [ ] elm-review editor setup
  - [ ] disable elm analyze emacs setup - this is in lsp?
  - [ ] add elm review emacs setup (or switch to intellij?)
  - [ ] investigate elm-pair emacs setup
- [ ] use ints for times in json instead of DateTime?
- [ ] make a 'banned identifier names' elm review rule

* Next Time
- don't use elm-tailwind-modules, it'll never get on TW 3.0
- use a configured default app database in prod instead of 'postgres'
- use different types for redis serialization and graphql
- always send result types in a subscription stream
  and always use boxed streams instead of plain generics
- use customized scalar codecs from the beginning, if using graphql
